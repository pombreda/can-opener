============
Things To Do
============

* BETTER DOCUMENTATION (and somewhere else than in this source)

* Actually put some documentation in the code too

* Maybe promote "grant" as first-order entity, now the required
  information is passed in an ugly manner via tuples

* Add a configuration file that can add/remove can default to
  (automatically close and plug holes)

* Perhaps some --background option to allow this run as a background
  program and periodically update entries.. so that you could even run
  this as a session too. hmm, maybe not, that's not terribly good
  security practice

* Change logic so that its possible to defined different port ranges
  to different sgs (maybe only for config file use)

* Implement --initialize option

* Move repository to real project, make easily packaged and built
  script (can-opener, not can-opener.py)

* Add license information (GPL or some similar suitable for a
  command-line tool)
